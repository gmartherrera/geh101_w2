---

<br>

Geographic knowledge and science has been, and still is, fundamental for exploring and interacting with our environment at multiple scales.

<br>

:::{.incremental}

* Where = spatial location

* What = event

* When = time (temporal location)

* Why = causation - interactions

* Why there = spatial correlation

:::

:::{.notes}

where: Spatial location - position
what: Event or process
When: Temporal dimension
Why: Causation - interactions
Why there: Spatial correlation, proximity, teleconnections (climate change), complexity 

:::

# Area analysis

<br>

Focuses on describing, exploring, and gathering geographical data of places.

Area analysis use three concepts to organize and describe this data:
 
:::{.incremental}

* Site
* Situation
* Region

:::

---

## Site

<br>

Precise location using a coordinate system (latitude and longitude)

Cultural properties of the place (symbolic meaning)

Unique combination of biophysical and cultural features (like personalities)

# Spatial analysis

<br>

Focuses on exploring and explaining spatial patterns of events, processes, and
relationships.

<br>

What is a pattern?

Why are they important for geogpraphy?

<br>

:::{.incremental}

* Distribution

* Movement

:::

## Distribution

<br>

Spatial arrangement or configuration of observations.

Distribution can be defined using its **density**, **concentration**,
and **pattern**

---

**Density** refers to the frequency of events in a geographical area
(can be expressed as a ratio)

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

* Seeds per dm³
* COVID-19 cases per borough
* Trees per block

:::

---

**Concentration** refers to the configuration or distribution of of events
or phenomena focusing on proximity.

<br>

* Concentrated: Close proximity (important for diseases) 

* Dispersed: Scattered in space

---

The **pattern** is the particular geometrical configuration or arrangement of a set of events.

## Movement

<br>

Movement allows to perceive changes of spatial distributions.

<br>

Movement  can be evaluated in terms of **distance** or **diffusion** of phenomena.

## Distance {.smaller}

<br>

The magnitude of proximity between events or phenomena.  Can be measured, expressed, and *perceived* in multiple ways. 

<br>

* **Absolute**: miles, kilometers, centimeters (abstraction).

* **Temporal**:

  - Time to arrive from point A to B. 
  - Integrate the geographical context like topography (surface features).
  - Important for logistics (transportation).

* **Economic**:     

  - What is the cost of getting from A to B?
  
  - Cost distance


---

**Distance friction** reduces mobility and diffusion through space.

# Geographic Systems Analysis

<br>

<br>

What is a system?

Models are representations of aspects of the reality used to **describe** or **explain** a phenomenon.


## Earth as a system

<br>

From the perspective of natural sciences, Earth can be viewed as a set of interacting 
systems.

<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

## Geographic grid

<br>

System of lines that functions as a geographical reference for positioning. 
<br>

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

The grid includes:

* Equator 
* Latitude
* Longitude

:::

:::{.column}

![](equator.png){fig-align="center"}

:::

::::


## Latitude {.smaller}

<br>

* Angular distance from the equator to any point to the north or south. 

* The line connecting all points of the same latitude is called a **parallel**.

* Infinite number of parallels.

::::{.columns}

:::{.column}

:::

::::

## Longitude {.smaller}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column}

* The angular distance measured east and west with reference to the **prime meridian**; the meridian that crosses the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England.

* The prime meridian was chosen in 1884.

* Constituted by meridians that range from 0° to 180°.

* Also measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds.

![](grid.png){fig-align="center"}

## Time zones {.smaller}

<br>

* Useful for homogenizing time differences across long east-west distances.

* Based on the equivalence of the distance traveled by the sun in a day

> 1 day = 24 hours = 360° 

> 1 hour = 15°

* Time is standardized relative to the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) at 0° longitude by 15°.


---

Time standardization is done eastward by one hour (15°). 

Political and economic decisions 'bend' the boundaries of time zones.

International date line marks the difference between one calendar day and another.

# Mapping and its properties

---

<br>

Maps are models of the Earth's surface and its features. They are useful for regional, urban, and financial planning, resource management, military operations, risk assessment, etc.

<br>

* Two-dimensional: X and Y coordinates.

* Topical: Focus on certain type of information.


## Elements

<br>

* Title: Name of the map

* **Scale**: The scale of a map is an element used to inform about the size, distance, or area equivalences between reality and the representation

* North arrow

* Legend (if applicable): Summary of visual features displayed (colors, shapes, shades, etc.)

* Reference grid: Enable locating the sites displayed in a particular  **projection**

---

![](scale.png){fig-align="center"}

## Small scale 

![](fuji_small.png){fig-align="center"}


## Large scale

![](fuji_large.png){fig-align="center"}


## Projection {.smaller}

<br>

* It is impossible to fit a 3D reality into a flat surface without **distortions**.

* Distortions are higher for smaller scales. Types include: 

  - Size and distance: Proportions are not constant. 
  - Shape and orientation: Deformations

* The projection of a map determines how the elements we want to display are represented.

* Map projections correct **some** distortions.

* Map projections are case specific. What do I want to show? What is fundamental or relevant?


## Conformal projection {.smaller}

<br>

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column}

  * Keeps shape and orientation
  
  * Distorts size towards the poles
  
  * Latitudinal and longitudinal lines form a rectangular grid

## Equal-area projection {.smaller}

* GIS are a kind of software that allow the exploration, manipulation, and visualization of spatial and non-spatial information.

Three type of data:
